# SSH-Type

The first ever (?) command-line typing test. This project was heavily inspired by MonkeyType and `terminal.shop`.

## How it Works

1. By running `ssh TBD.com` in your terminal, the CLI will be loaded with the typing test.
2. You can use the given settings at the top to customize the test.
3. As soon as the first alpha key is triggered, the timer and test will begin.
4. After the time ends, you WPM and Accuracy will be shown.

This is my very first Golang project.
