# SSH-Type

The first ever (?) command-line typing test. This project was heavily inspired by MonkeyType and `terminal.shop`.

## How it Works

1. By running `ssh TBD.com` in your terminal, the CLI will be loaded with the typing test.
2. You may use the given settings at the top to customize.
3. As soon as the first alpha key is triggered, the timer and test begin.
4. After the time ends, you WPM and Accuracy will be shown (hopefully on the leaderboard).

This is my very first Golang project.
